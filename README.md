## Name
Emoji Garden

## Description
Emoji Garden is a completed sample project that guides users to a Public Location so they can localize and engage in Shared AR play. (Public Locations are publicly accessible real-world locations that are unique or notable in some way and are VPS-Activated for apps to engage with them). The sample comes with Location AR UX, which uses the [Maps SDK](https://lightship.dev/docs/maps) and [Coverage API](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/apiref/Niantic/Lightship/AR/VpsCoverage/) to help users understand where they are in relation to Public Locations. Location AR UX also helps users connect to Public Locations and gives them guidance if localization isnâ€™t working as expected. For more detailed information on this project, please see the [Emoji Garden project documentation](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/emoji_garden/) on the Lightship documentation site. 

## Deploying and Running Emoji Garden
To deploy Emoji Garden on your device:
1. Clone the project.
2. Navigate to the [Lightship dev site](https://www.lightship.dev/) and copy your API key.
3. Set your Lightship API key in two places:
4. In the *Lightship* top menu, select *Settings*, then enter your API key.
5. In the *Project* window under *Assets*, find the *Localization UX* directory. From there, navigate to *Resources* *>* *Maps* *>* *SDK* *>* *MapsAuthConfig* *>* *LightshipApiKey* and enter your API key again.
6. In the *File* top menu, select *Build Settings*, then choose one of the supported platforms, *iOS* or *Android*.
7. Click *Build and Run* to run Emoji Garden on your device. The map will display, allowing you to localize to a nearby Public Location.

## Troubleshooting and Common Issues
- My API key is missing!
	- Make sure to set your API key in both locations! See step 3 of [Deploying and Running Emoji Garden](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/emoji_garden/#deploying-and-running-emoji-garden).
- No locations are showing up after I run the app!
	- You might not be in range of any Public Locations. If there are none near you, use a [Test Scan](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/emoji_garden/#test-scans)!
- My public VPS scan isn't localizing!
	- Make sure the lighting and weather conditions are good. VPS works best in daytime under clear skies.
	- If conditions are good and you still can't localize, try another Public Location.
- My Test Scan location is in the wrong place / not showing up!
	- Double-check the location manifest's coordinate values in the Unity Inspector to make sure they match what is on the Geospatial Browser.
	- Remove and re-set the Test Scan location in the `CoverageClient` component.

## Support
For any other issues, [contact us](https://lightship.dev/docs/ardk/contact_us/) on Discord or the Lightship forums! Before reaching out, open the Console Log by holding three touches on your device's screen for three seconds, then take a screenshot and post it along with a description of your issue.
